  <description>Allows you to recruit visitors. At a price, of course. 

You can also improve your relationship with visiting factions and sell items to visiting guests. Guests will buy and use things inside of their allowed area.


Errors and bugs: If you get errors, most likely Hospitality is clashing with another mod you're using.

So to help me fix bugs, please describe clearly what happened. Also please upload the output_log.txt file from Rimworld's data folder or enable the developer console and upload a screenshot of the first error you're getting. If you think it might be conflicting with another mod, please list the mods you're using in the order they get loaded. 

Hospitality requires the HugsLib mod to be loaded first.
